This is my first project with The Odin Project.

In this project I will pracitice basic HTML, then add CSS later to improve the functionality of the site.

I have added three recipes that can be made in an air fryer. So far this site only uses basic HTML with the exception of one style element in the imaged to set the max-width. In later sections of The Odin Project, I will be adding more styling with CSS and perhaps even some Javascript later.
